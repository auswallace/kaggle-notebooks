I am also interested in learning what other features may be important predictors of student grades. Just a word of warning, I am not going to attempt to predict student grade evolution over marking periods since all the features in the dataset (other than grades) remain constant over marking periods and are general descriptors of student backgrounds. My results indicate that while alcohol consumption on weekdays and weekends are not the strongest predictor of student average grades, they are in the top 10 (out of 29). The two strongest predictors of student average grade are the willingness to pursue higher education (higher) and (guess what?) mother's education (Medu).\n\n\n----------\n\n\nThe notebook is organized as follows. I first conduct some EDA to see if the two tables (with math and Portuguese grades) can be combined. After combining the two tables, I obtain student average grades over marking periods and estimate 3 models: linear, regression tree, and random forest. Some quick cross-validation indicates that the random forest is the best performing model out of the three. Finally, I use the best-performing random forest to rank features by their importance.","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"64a6eb28-ef1e-efe7-cf41-f7e78a559bfa","_uuid":"0fefa23157ea18293bca4eb27b9486ff715f7ee5"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First, I would ideally like to combine both tables into one.

Removing either of these two variables will increase the MSE of predictions by between 10-20%. \n\nWhat's interesting about these results is that some features that would be conventionally thought as important did not end up in the top ten list (I would speculate that the variables such as Pstatus, famsupport, famrel, & absences are among those) while some other variables (such as higher and Medu) turned out to be very important. \n\nIn what follows, I am going to produce a partial dependence plot for each feature in the dataset (ranked by importance). Partial dependence plots give a graphical depiction of the marginal effect of a feature on the response. In this case, partial dependencies are produced by the best performing Random Forest model with 500 trees.  As the plots indicate, shifting from \"very low\" levels to just \"low\" levels of alcohol consumption on weekdays, will reduce the expected average grade from 11.22 to 10.88. Similarly, moving from \"very low\" levels to just \"low\" levels of alcohol consumption on weekends will reduce the average predicted grade from 11.19 to 11.17. \n\nAs a conclusion, the impact of the most important 2 variables, \"higher\" and \"Medu,\" on average student grade is as follows: \n\n - **higher**: willingness to pursue higher education increases average predicted grade from 9.42 to 11.25. Thus, motivate your kids to pursue higher education is the best thing you can do to improve their grades in school!\n - **Medu**: increase in mother's education from none to more than secondary education increases predicted average grade from 10.8 to 11.5. Thus, advice to future parents (especially fathers): If you want your future children do well in school marry someone educated.","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"6d894008-a89e-0940-0124-e354ded64dcf","_uuid":"1fdbed1f94cc2f5bd02752d913513a83f6a3c325"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"imp <- importance(rf2)\nimpvar <- rownames(imp)[order(imp[, 1], decreasing=TRUE)]\nop <- par(mfrow=c(2, 3))\nfor (i in seq_along(impvar)) {\n  partialPlot(rf2, d3norepeats[,1:30], impvar[i], ,rug=TRUE, xlab=impvar[i],\n              main=paste(\"Partial Dependence on\", impvar[i]))\n  abline(h=mean(d3norepeats$avggrades),col=\"red\")\n}\npar(op)","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"5d4ad76a-750a-7d0c-93ee-839f7fcc6f0d","_uuid":"1e111da64d8d9f0aa102c0dbabf47fb4b0ac756d","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
