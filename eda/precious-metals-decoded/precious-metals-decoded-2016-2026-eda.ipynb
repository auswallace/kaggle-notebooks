Unlike equities, there are no earnings reports or P/E ratios to anchor valuation. Prices are driven almost entirely by narrative, macro conditions, and supply-demand dynamics. That makes them both challenging and rewarding for data analysis.\n\nThis dataset gives us roughly 2,500 daily observations spanning February 2016 through January 2026 — a decade that includes the pre-COVID calm, the pandemic shock, the post-stimulus recovery, and what appears to be an extraordinary breakout rally in 2025. We've got three metals (silver, gold, platinum), pre-computed returns, volatility measures, and moving averages. That's a solid foundation to work with.\n\nHere's the game plan for this EDA:\n1. **Data quality & structure** — trust but verify before we do anything else\n2. **Price evolution** — what happened over the decade, and when did things get weird?\n3. **Normalized performance** — which metal actually won the race?\n4. **Return distributions** — are these returns \"normal\"? (spoiler: no)\n5. **The gold-silver ratio** — a classic macro indicator that's screaming right now\n6. **Volatility regimes** — when did the market mood change?\n7. **Correlations** — do these metals really move together, or is that a myth?\n8. **Seasonality** — are there monthly patterns worth knowing about?\n9. **Moving average signals** — what are the trend-following indicators telling us?\n10. **The 2025 rally** — a deep dive into the most dramatic move in the dataset\n11. **Extreme days** — the biggest wins and biggest losses\n12. **Forecast critique** — is the provided forecast any good?\n\nLet's get into it.\n\n---","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1 · Setup & Data Loading\n\nNothing fancy here, just loading our libraries, setting up a clean dark theme for the visuals, and reading in the two CSV files.

The gold-silver ratio simply divides the gold price by the silver price, and it tells you something profound about market sentiment.\n\n**Here's the intuition:** Gold is the ultimate \"safe haven\". when people are scared, they buy gold. Silver, on the other hand, has a dual identity: it's partly a precious metal (like gold) but also an industrial metal used in electronics, solar panels, and manufacturing. So when the economy is doing well and risk appetite is high, silver tends to outperform gold (ratio falls). When fear dominates, gold outperforms (ratio rises).\n\nHistorically, the ratio has averaged around 60–80 in real-world markets. Extreme readings in either direction tend to mean-revert, making this a useful contrarian signal.

This isn't a case of silver passively following gold — silver was the driver, with gold playing catch-up.\n\n- **Cumulative returns (middle-left):** Silver's cumulative return from January 2025 dwarfs gold and platinum. We're talking about a multi-hundred-percent move in roughly a year. For context, silver historically returns maybe 5–10% annually. This is a 10+ year move compressed into months.\n\n- **Volatility (middle-right):** Silver's vol ramped steadily through the rally and then spiked further at the end. This is the classic pattern of a climactic move — volatility expands as price accelerates, then explodes during the reversal. Gold's volatility, while elevated, remained much more contained.\n\n- **Ratio compression (bottom-left):** The gold-silver ratio fell steadily throughout the rally, confirming that silver was the dominant force. The ratio bottomed right before the crash — exactly when silver was most overextended.\n\n- **Return scatter (bottom-right):** The scatter shows silver's returns becoming increasingly extreme relative to gold as the rally progressed (dots spreading vertically). And that \"Jan 30 Crash\" annotation? It's the biggest outlier in the plot; a synchronized selloff where both metals dropped hard, but silver got hit far worse.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 12 · Extreme Days: Largest Moves in the Dataset\nLet's put concrete numbers on the tail events.

Any analysis of this dataset *must* account for this regime shift. Training a model on \"the full dataset\" without acknowledging the structural break would be a serious methodological error.\n\n2. **Fat tails are real and significant.** All three metals reject normality with extreme kurtosis. The practical implication: risk models that assume Gaussian returns would have badly underestimated the January 30, 2026 crash. If you're building position-sizing or stop-loss logic, use Student's t or empirical distributions, not normal curves.\n\n3. **The gold-silver ratio is at an extreme (~4.7)** and historically extreme readings mean-revert. This is probably the single most actionable signal in the dataset; it suggests silver is overextended relative to gold and that a correction (or gold catch-up) is likely over the medium term.\n\n4. **Volatility regimes are distinct and identifiable.** The 2025–26 vol regime is structurally different from 2016–2024. This isn't just \"more of the same but louder\" it's a fundamentally different market environment. Regime-aware models (HMM, Markov-switching) would likely outperform regime-blind approaches here.\n\n5. **Correlations aren't constant, they're regime-dependent.** The rolling 90-day silver-gold correlation varies from ~0 to ~0.85. Portfolio diversification between these metals only works in calm markets; in crises, they move together.\n\n6. **The provided linear forecast is naive and already wrong.** It extrapolates rally momentum with zero volatility and constant weekly increments. The January 30 crash (-15% silver) already invalidated its near-term projections. This opens the door for us to build something better.\n\n---\n\n**Where to go from here:**\n\nThe natural next steps would be (1) formal regime detection using Hidden Markov Models to label the market states we've visually identified, (2) GARCH volatility modeling to capture the clustering dynamics, and (3) a proper walk-forward forecasting framework that adapts to regime shifts rather than ignoring them. The dataset is well-suited for all three, and the 2025 breakout provides a perfect stress test for any model we build.\n\n*Thanks for reading — feedback and discussion welcome!*","metadata":{}}]}
